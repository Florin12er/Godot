* Godot:
** How to run a game:
- make a new 2d or 3d node
- run the game by pressing the run button

** Buttons:
- you can add buttons to your node using the add button and add
  text to it in the left of the screen.
** Programming Languages:
- you can use c# and gdscript tools for neovim already configured to work
** CSHARP(C#):
1. Performance: C# is generally faster than GDScript due to its compiled nature and optimizations provided by .NET runtime.
2. Ecosystem: C# has a large ecosystem with extensive libraries and frameworks like .NET Core, Unity, and Xamarin. It's widely
   used in enterprise development and game development (via Unity).
3. Syntax: C# syntax is similar to Java and C++,
   making it familiar to developers coming from those backgrounds. It's statically typed, which can help catch errors at compile-time.
4. Tooling: C# has robust tooling support with Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code offering powerful IDE features
   like IntelliSense, debugging, and refactoring tools.
5. Cross-platform: With .NET Core, C# can be used to develop
   cross-platform applications, although Unity remains the primary choice for game development.

** GDScript:

1. Ease of Use: GDScript is designed specifically for use with the Godot game engine. It's dynamically typed and
   has a simpler syntax compared to C#, which can be more accessible for beginners and smaller teams.

2. Integration with Godot: GDScript integrates seamlessly with Godot Engine, providing direct access to engine features and nodes.

3. Performance: While not as performant as C#, GDScript's performance is generally acceptable for most
   2D and some 3D games. It's optimized for use within the Godot Engine.

4. Scene Control: GDScript is well-suited for controlling game logic, managing scenes,
   and handling events within the Godot Engine ecosystem.

5. Community and Learning Resources: Godot and GDScript have a growing community and a
   wealth of tutorials and resources specifically tailored to using GDScript with Go

** Sprites:
- you can sprites with the add button
- sprites are your the things your are seing in the game
- you can make sprites with tools like GIMP, Adobe, Krita, Inkscape
